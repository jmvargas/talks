* Main features
- Fast, focused in concurrency & performance
- Good learning curve, ridiculous simply
- It works on all OS
- Statically typed
- Source code writed in Go
- Awesome std lib & lots of tools
- Fast cross-compilation to machine code

* Who made it?
Designed by people like:
- Rob Pike, co-creator of UTF-8
- Ken Thompson, co-creator of UNIX
- Robert Griesemer, worked in  Google's V8 JavaScript engine

* How this talk is structured?

I'll present Go features example by example

I'll try to avoid any external library. 

Please don't focus on syntax. Better keep with concepts.

* #1 Do you ever deal with many string encoding formats?

* Go is UTF-8 by default

.play -edit go-by-example/utf8-by-default/main.go

_Couriosity:_Rob_Pike,_one_of_golang_co-creator_is_also_co-creator_of_UTF-8_

* #2 Checks before compilation

* What about if you declare a var and you don't use it

.play -edit go-by-example/checks-before/main.go

* #3 Hello world HTTP server

* Hello world HTTP server

.play -edit go-by-example/hello-world-http/main.go

* #4 Ridiculous minimal Docker images

* It plays well with Docker

.code go-by-example/minimal-docker-images/Dockerfile
.code go-by-example/minimal-docker-images/build.sh

* #5 Serialization/Deserialization

* Deserialization from JSON

.play -edit go-by-example/serialization/deserialization.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Serialization to JSON

.play -edit go-by-example/serialization/serialization.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* #6 Error handling

* Error handling

.play -edit go-by-example/error-handling/101.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Error handling

.play -edit go-by-example/error-handling/102.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Error handling

.play -edit go-by-example/error-handling/103.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* #7 Concurrency: Goroutines

* Fun vs Fast

* Fun vs Concurrent

* Hello world Goroutines

.play -edit go-by-example/concurrency/101.go

* Question: What happen if I click run?

.play -edit go-by-example/concurrency/102.go

* #8 Concurrency: Even better with channels

* Diagram
- Workers can't take the same job twice
.image go-by-example/images/worker-job.svg _ 1000

* Worker-Job example: Channels & Goroutines allows concurrency

.play -edit go-by-example/concurrency/103.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* #9 Testing

* We have this server

.play -edit go-by-example/testing/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* And we have these tests
.code go-by-example/testing/main_test.go /^func TestHandler/,/^}/

* And we have these tests
.code go-by-example/testing/main_test.go /^func TestHandlerFail/,/^}/

* #10 Benchmarks

* Benchmarks: Pretty similar to tests

.code go-by-example/testing/main_test.go /^func BenchmarkHandler/,/^}/



* What's next?
