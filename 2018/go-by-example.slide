* Main features
- Fast, focused in concurrency & performance
- Ridiculous simply, good learning curve
- Work in all OS, cross-compile
- Strong typed
- Source code writed in Go
- Awesome std lib & lots of tools
- Fast compilation

* How are this talk is structured?

I'll present Go features example by example

I'll try to avoid any external library. 

Please don't focus on syntax. Better keep with concepts.

* #1 Do you ever deal with many string encoding formats?

* Go is UTF-8 by default

.play go-by-example/utf8-by-default/main.go

_Couriosity:_Rob_Pike,_one_of_golang_co-creator_is_also_co-creator_of_UTF-8_

* #2 Hello world HTTP server

* Hello world HTTP server (without external libs)

.play go-by-example/hello-world-http/main.go

* #3 Checks before compilation

* What about if you declare a var and you don't use it

.play go-by-example/checks-before/main.go

* #4 Error handling

* Error handling

.play go-by-example/error-handling/main.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* #5 Testing

* We have this server

.play go-by-example/testing/main.go

* And we have these tests
.code go-by-example/testing/main_test.go /^func TestHandler/,/^}/

* #6 Benchmarks

* Benchmarks: Pretty similar to tests

.code go-by-example/testing/main_test.go /^func BenchmarkHandler/,/^}/

* #7 Ridiculous minimal Docker images

* It plays well with Docker

.code go-by-example/minimal-docker-images/Dockerfile
.code go-by-example/minimal-docker-images/build.sh

* #8 Serialization/Deserialization

* Serialization to JSON

.play go-by-example/serialization/serialization.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Deserialization from JSON

.play go-by-example/serialization/deserialization.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* #9 Concurrency: Goroutines

* Hello world Goroutines

.play go-by-example/concurrency/101.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Question: What happen if I click run?

.play go-by-example/concurrency/102.go

* #10 Concurrency: Even better with channels

* Diagram
- Workers can't take the same job twice
.image go-by-example/images/worker-job.svg _ 1000

* Worker-Job example: Channels & Goroutines allows concurrency

.play go-by-example/concurrency/103.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* What's next?
